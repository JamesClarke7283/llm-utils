# LLM Utils
This project is a group of tools that make working with LLMs in your project easier, and more efficient. from turning codebases into prompts, to converting YouTube videos to text (transcriptions). This might help you.

These tools are mostly written for myself, but feel free to use and modify them to your needs.
